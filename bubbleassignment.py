# Reflection Questions:

# 1. When there has been no swaps, stated by the "swapped" variable.
# 2. It will go through it and see that there are no swaps and will stop.
# 3. To tell the computer if there was a swap or not.
# 4. To know what you are writing and if there are any bugs, know where they are and how to fix them.
